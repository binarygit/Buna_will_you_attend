# Buna, Will You Attend?

This is an **accessible** website powered by Ruby on Rails. **Buna** is my _sanima_ (my mother's little sister), who is blind and lives in the USA. She comes to Nepal time and again to meet the family or when there's some event or festival happening. Hence, this website where my family members (or other people) can post an event and see whether Buna will attend it or not.

Here is the live site: https://cryptic-woodland-68204.herokuapp.com/

# Challenges

1. Accessibility. Buna is blind and my knowledge about accessibility ended with the `alt` tag.
2. Inferior knowledge of `HTML` and `CSS` was an obstacle to create mobile friendly site.
3. No knowledge on how to test a Rails app was a serious drawback as I couldn't refactor with confidence. Also a huge time drain when you have to do a thing again and again to make sure it's working.  

I ovecame my lack of knowledge on accessibility and `HTML` and `CSS` by using the learning resources provided by MDN. The [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS), and [Accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility) modules helped me alot to broaden my understanding of these tools and use them effectively.

For Rails testing, I read the [Rails Guide on Testing](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html) and asked questions in the Rails slack chat whenever I got stuck.

In addition to these, I had to think about authorization too in this project as the things a *normal User* and *Buna* are allowed to do are different.

# Key Implementations

1. Authentication From Scratch
2. Controller and System Tests
3. Mobile Friendly
4. Different Authorization for different users
